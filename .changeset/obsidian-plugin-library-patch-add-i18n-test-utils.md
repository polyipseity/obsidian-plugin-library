---

Add comprehensive unit tests covering the entire library.

This patch adds and updates unit tests across the library (core utilities, inject, settings, platform, i18n helpers, and test-support utilities). The tests stabilize existing flaky cases, improve coverage, and verify edge-case behavior. All changes are test-only — no runtime or public API changes.
